## Overview

Implementation of the Photoxic Lipid Model (PTLM) for the calculation of
Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
(PAH).

This package uses the Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV)
Radiation Model (<https://github.com/NCAR/TUV>) to calculate the light
penetration through water of a given depth at a given location, with a
specified Dissolved Organic Carbon concentration. The light exposure is
then used (along with the PAH-specific molar absorption across a range
of wavelengths), to calculate the light absorption (Pabs) of the given
PAH at that location. This is then used to determine the PLC50.

## Installation

In order to install this package you will need a development toolchain
installed on your computer (specifically `gfortran`) to compile the
Fortran code for the TUV model.

On a Mac, the easiest way to get started is to use
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and install `gcc`, which includes
`gfortran`:

    brew install gcc

On Windows, you need to install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Make sure that
you install the appropriate version for your version of R (i.e.Â Rtools
4.0 for R 4.0.x, Rtools 4.3 for R 4.3.x, etc.).

Once you have Rtools (Windows) or `gcc` (Mac), you can install the
package with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/pahwq")
```

## Example usage

To calculate the acute phototoxic water quality guideline (PLC50) for
Anthracene at 0.25 m depth in Okanagan Lake on June 21, 2023, with a
measured DOC of 5 g/m^3, you can use the following code:

``` r
library(pahwq)

# Set the options for the TUV model run:
set_tuv_aq_params(
  depth_m = 0.25,
  lat = 49.601632,
  lon = -119.605862,
  elev_km = 0.342,
  DOC = 5,
  date = "2023-06-21",
  tzone = -8L
)

# Run the TUV model
run_tuv()

# Get the results
res <- get_tuv_results(file = "out_irrad_y")
head(res)

### Options

pahwq creates a directory on your computer to store the TUV model input
and output files. By default, the location of this is set automatically
to a standard location (determined by `tools::R_user_dir`). You can
change the location of this directory by setting the
`pahwq.tuv_data_dir` option:

``` r
options("pahwq.tuv_data_dir" = "path/to/my/tuv/data")
```
